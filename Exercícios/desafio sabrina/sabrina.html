            Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh <br>
            Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh <br>
            Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh <br>
            Oh, oh, oh <br>

        Think I only want one number in my phone <br>
        I might change your contact to Don't Leave Me Alone <br>
        You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll <br>
        Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        But I can't help myself when you get close to me <br>
        Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like: Blee-blah-blee <br>
        I don't want no one else (no, no), baby, I'm in too deep <br>
        Here's a little song I wrote (a song I wrote) <br>
        It's about you and me (me) <br>

        I'll be honest <br>
        Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense <br>
        Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in <br>
        And when you got your arms around me <br>
        Oh, it feels so good I had to jump the octave <br>
        I think I got an ex, but I forgot him <br>
        And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it <br>
        I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense <br>
        I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (ah-ah-ah), I'm talkin' <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I'm talkin' all around the clock <br>
        I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks <br>
        I'm talkin' opposite of soft <br>
        I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts <br>
        You gotta keep up with me <br>
        I got some young energy <br>
        I cop that L-O-V-E <br>
        How do you do this to me? <br>

        This song catchier than chickenpox is <br>
        I bet your house is where my other sock is <br>
        Woke up this morning thought I'd write a pop  hit (ha, haha) <br>
        How quickly can you take your clothes off? Pop quiz <br>
        Hahaha <br>
        That one's not gonna make it
        Ha, haha, haha <br>
        Most of these aren't gonna make it <br>
